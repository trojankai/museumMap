# Project 6 Neighborhood Map
In this project, we were tasked with creating a Single Page application using the Knockout JS library, Google Maps, as well as an API to make an interactive map that doesn’t require refreshing the page.

### To use the application
Download the .zip file and open the index.html, or for the live version, go to [http://trojankai.github.io/museumMap/index.html]

The minified files have been used in the live version, but the "pretty" files are in the src folder.

### Technologies used
- Code Editor — Atom
- Libraries — KnockoutJS and jQuery
- Build tools — Gulp
- Chrome DevTools

### Refenences used
The Forums were invaluable for this project, also I used StackOverflow and a website that specifically gave insight to the filter utility function in Knockout was [http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html]
